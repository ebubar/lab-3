# Lab 3

CODE FILE TO EDIT:  lab3.py

This lab explores the ideas of mutability and aliasing through manipulating tuples and lists

The goal of the lab is to complete each of the functions p1, p2, p3, and if you have time, the bonus question, according to the function's docstring Pay special attention to how the function is supposed to handle mutability.  The functions are all ready to edit in the file labeled lab3.py.  Edit that file and push your edits to your personal repository.  Your final push after the due date/time will be the one that is graded.

Some basic tests are included in the `if __name__ == '__main__'` to allow you to easily test your code.
